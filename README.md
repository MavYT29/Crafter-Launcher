## How to use & Information
- before you press the start button on the Crafter Launcher you must first press JAVA / SERVER to correctly locate the Java Path and the Server Path then after that start your server
- and when an error like "Error: Available RAM is critically low!" just click the Reset Button
- just check first how much ram you have available if it's only 400mb it will automatically be disabled because the normal ram is 800mb it should be up
