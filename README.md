## Installation
- Download the [Launcher](https://api.fork.gg/download/launcher) 
- Run the Launcher and enjoy

## How to use
- before you press the start button on the Crafter Launcher you must first press JAVA / SERVER to correctly locate the Java Path and the Server Path then after that start your server
- and when an error like "Error: Available RAM is critically low!" just click the Reset Button
- just check first how much ram you have available if it's only 400mb it will automatically be disabled because the normal ram is 800mb it should be up

## Don't Forget ⚠︎
- I can't publish the source code of my Crafter Launcher yet, but I will release it soon
